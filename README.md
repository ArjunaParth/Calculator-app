Calculator App
by Parth Pandey

This is a simple Python project that I created in order to get some practice with programming and mathematical concepts.
The calculator has both normal and scientific modes. 
The normal mode performs
simple calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, 
while the scientific mode has trigonometric functions, powers, square roots, factorial, logarithms and a couple of others.

I created this project primarily to enhance my logic and learn how functions and user input operate in Python. 
It can directly be run in the terminal and is convenient to use. 
It's a basic but handy project to learn and for any individual interested in seeing how calculators function internally.

This project taught me how to organize code, deal with errors, 
and create something that seems to be finished and interactive.
It's not excellent, but it's a labor of love and concern.
